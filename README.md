# Production-Costs-application

This project was done to design a shiny application using a LP method. The application has multiple tabs defining problem statement, inputting the desired values to optimize, and a summarization table with the input values and the implication of results. The problem statement is defined for a particular example, so the results are also explained for the same problem. But the optimization can be done for any desired values and we can check results for those values also.
